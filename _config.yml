  text: "Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) is a grassroots, member-led, statewide community organization working with more than 10,000 members across California. ACCE is dedicated to raising the voices of everyday Californians, neighborhood by neighborhood, to fight for the policies and programs we need to improve our communities and create a brighter future. ACCE takes a serious commitment to ground-up organizing to build a strong people’s movement that can create transformative community change. Local neighborhood chapters and issue committees, led by ACCE Action member leaders, meet regularly to strategize and plan campaigns. Central to this work is the belief that there’s power in numbers and in collective action – ACCE Action members and allies frequently “take to the streets” with rallies, town halls, and other actions to make our voices heard."

Through a bottom-up approach, California Calls organizes voters most impacted by budget cuts and deteriorating public services in support of systemic, progressive solutions to our state’s fiscal crisis. Working together, and including those who are often left out of policy decisions, California Calls reclaims the California Dream of equality, opportunity and prosperity for all Californians."

CHIRLA’s mission is to achieve a just society fully inclusive of immigrants. CHIRLA organizes and serves individuals, institutions and coalitions to build power, transform public opinion, and change policies to achieve full human, civil and labor rights. Guided by the power, love, and vision of our community, CHIRLA embraces and drives progressive social change. CHIRLA was formed in response to the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 that made hiring undocumented workers illegal, creating a situation ripe for worker exploitation and abuse which has only increased since that time."
