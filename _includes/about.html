                    <h4>Who is MVP?</h4>
                    <p>The Million Voters Project (MVP) is an unprecedented movement building the collective power of the growing electorate in California. We mobilize Blacks, Latinos, Asian Pacific Islanders, immigrants, refugees, faith-based constituencies, and young voters to take part in shaping our political landscape. Together, we work to ensure that the policies affecting us will reflect our diverse needs, values, and experiences.</p>
                    <p>MVP is a collaboration of California’s strongest community-based networks: Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN), California Calls, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), Mobilize the Immigrant Vote (MIV), PICO California, and Presente.org.</p>
                    <h4>Our Work</h4>
                    <p>The Million Voters Project is engaging the rising majority in California to vote and become active participants in our democracy. We are transforming the electorate by mobilizing over 700,000 new and infrequent voters to the polls in November 2016, and increasing our numbers to one million voters by 2018.</p>
                    <h4>Why</h4>
                    <p>Democracy cannot work for us until it includes us. Our families, friends, and neighbors are heavily impacted by racial profiling, state violence, low wages, and underfunded schools and services. This is why we must be at the forefront of policy change efforts. By voting together, we can win policy changes that lift us all up by rebuilding our neighborhoods, supporting our families, and restoring the promise of opportunity, and overcome the divisions within our communities.</p>

                    <p>Together, we comprise a rising majority in California who can leverage our influence to win policy changes. The power is in our hands and on our ballot. The time is now.</p>
                    <p>Our Vision for California:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><u>People Power:</u> Making government work for us by leveraging our collective power to win policy victories and build a culture of civic participation</p></li>
                        <li><p><u>Community Investment:</u> Reversing the cycle of disinvestment in our neighborhoods through sufficient and stable funding for schools, clinics, and affordable housing </p></li>
                        <li><p><u>Healthy Neighborhoods:</u> Sustaining the health of our families by protecting our land and ensuring access to clean air and water, affordable housing, and fresh food</p></li>
                        <li><p><u>Uniting Communities:</u> Building a society that values people of color, people of every immigration status, and people who are poor, formerly incarcerated, differently abled, and LGBTQI</p></li>
                        <li><p><u>Solidarity and Safety:</u> Strengthening our social fabric and responding as a united front to the targeting of our communities by law enforcement and the criminal justice system</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>How</h4>
                    <p>With our proven track record of mobilizing the vote, the Million Voters Project will reshape the face of the electorate by delivering one million voters to the polls by 2018. This is a major step toward activating a California voting base who has the ability to achieve bold policy victories. Over the next two years, our targeted organizing will reach people one-on-one, build relationships, and inspire people to vote consistently to reverse the low turnout trends that are hurting our state, our cities, and our families.</p>

                    <p>In 2016, we will turn out 700,000 voters to secure a decisive margin in ballot measures and make way for bigger reforms in 2018. Our communities hold the power to move California onto a new path that ensures equality, justice, and opportunity for all. We are a force that can ignite the vital changes our communities need to be healthy and thrive.</p>

                    <p>Our strategy is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Recruit and train a team of 8,000 volunteers who will engage neighbors on key issues</p></li>
                        <li><p>Build relationships with voters who typically stay home on election day – new and infrequent voters of color, young voters, low-income voters, refugee and immigrant voters – through phone calls, canvassing, and media outreach</p></li>
                        <li><p>Turn out 700,000 voters for November 8th voting day, and one million to vote by 2018 to impact key issues and exercise our collective power</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Values </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Racial, economic, environmental and social justice</p></li>
                        <li><p>Everyone has a vote - documented or not</p></li>
                        <li><p>Everyone has an opportunity/responsibility to shape our communities</p></li>
                        <li><p>Power to the people, not corporations and monied interests</p></li>
                        <li><p>Forging a new path towards freedom and opportunity by removing and reforming oppressive policies, institutions, and systems</p></li>
                    </ul>
