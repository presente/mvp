                        <h3>MILLION VOTERS PROJECT: Unprecedented Coalition launches, mobilizing diverse California voters to transform politics & electorate</h3>
                        <hr class="star-primary">
                        <h4>Massive outreach effort to new and infrequent voters kicks off on Voter Registration Day</h4>


                        <p>[California—September 26] The Million Voters Project (MVP), an innovative partnership among California’s most prominent community-based organizations is launching a large scale voter outreach drive on Tuesday, September 27, Voter Registration Day, to increase turnout among the emerging majority in the state. This game-changing campaign will hold events from San Diego to Oakland over next 6 weeks in a first step toward changing the electorate to reflect California’s growing diversity.</p>

                        <p>After a record low voter turnout in 2014, and recent polls predicting that the country’s largest voting blocs will stay home on Election Day, it’s clear that the electoral process is leaving many voters – and potential voters – disaffected. There are over seven million eligible, but unregistered, people in California, and five million more that will likely stay home on election day. To counter this, MVP is mobilizing black voters, Latinos, Asian Pacific Islanders, immigrants, refugees, faith-based constituencies, formerly incarcerated, and young voters, with a goal of registering 80,000 first-time voters by October 24, turning out more than 450,000 voters on November 8, and building to one million by 2018.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><u>Oakland, 9/27:</u> APEN will be hosting a National Voter Registration Day press conference and canvass in Oakland, Chinatown. Join us at 8:45am at the Pacific Renaissance Plaza, 388 9th Street, Oakland, CA 94607. </li>
                            <li><p><u>Los Angeles, 9/27:</u> CHIRLA joins the Los Angeles County Registrar’s Office for a press conference to celebrate National Voter Registration Day. Taco trucks, games, and information booths; a plane will fly over Los Angeles starting at 9:30am with a large banner reading “Register to Vote/Regístrese Para Votar.” 10am-2pm 12400 Imperial Hwy, Norwalk, CA 90650.  </p></li>
                            <li><p><u>Canvasses and Phonebanks</u> will take place in 47 Get-Out-The-Vote locations from 9/27 through the November 8 Election.</p></li>
                            <li><p><u>Voter Registration Teams</u> will be deployed in 19 Counties of the state through October 24, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Alameda, Orange, Kern and Tulare.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>MVP’s constituents are heavily impacted by racial profiling, state violence, low wages, and underfunded schools and services. MVP’s work to increase civic engagement will center these communities at the forefront of policy change efforts.</p>

                        <p>“There is so much noise and controversy surrounding this election cycle – but that won’t translate into voters coming out to the polls unless we’re able to connect with people directly, through one-to-one personal conversations,” said <b>Karla Zombro, Field Director for California Calls.</b> “Only 40% of new voters cast ballots in California’s June Primary. Our strategy is to start with voter registration, and then engage new and infrequent voters one-on-one to inspire them to get to the polls.” </p>

                        <p>“New Americans make up so many of the flavors, sounds, and textures of life in California. Yet, many of our communities are left out of political decision-making because they are not familiar with our civic processes. Voter registration is a critical first step to building a civically engaged populace that reflects who we are as a state. We are registering voters in hard-to-reach communities in twelve different languages including Arabic, Vietnamese, Somali, Spanish, and Tagalog,” shared <b>Aparna Shah, Executive Director of Mobilize the Immigrant Vote.</b> </p>

                        <p>“We believe that our diversity is our greatest strength,” stated <b>Adam Kruggel, Director of Organizing for PICO California.</b> “We need to embrace the notion that we belong to one another and vote for measures that promote racial inclusion and justice for all people. In California, that means welcoming immigrants, bringing liberty to those who have been held captive by an unjust criminal justice system, and sharing our wealth so that we can build a better future for all of our children.”</p>

                        <p>“We have an opportunity this year to exercise our community's muscle and vote for the issues that impact our daily lives. Our voice, our lives, our needs should be decided by our community without fear of being too bold or too loud. The more we vote, the more respect and accountability we can expect from our elected officials," stated <b>Angelica Salas, Executive Director of CHIRLA.</b></p>

                        <p>"Low-income API immigrants and refugees in Oakland, Richmond and across California have long endured the cumulative impacts of housing insecurity, pollution and climate change. Now, we are a growing political force in the state and we are voting to advance solutions in our neighborhoods, like clean air, renter protections and a democracy that works for all of California," said <b>Miya Yoshitani of Asian Pacific Environmental Network.</b> </p>

                        <p>"With corporations, hedge funds, and real estate developers spending more and more in each election to support issues and candidates that share their vision of profits over people, our communities are under attack in every election. But, we have proven that when we are engaged and organized, not only can we defeat their attacks but we can pass strong policies that benefit our communities," said <b>Joseph Delgado, Campaign Coordinator at Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) Action.</b></p>

                        <p>"We’ve set an ambitious goal to reach and engage at least one million underrepresented and otherwise ignored voters in California. This powerful convergence is right on time and MVP has the people and the strategy – online and offline – to make our vision of a lasting, growing movement throughout this election cycle and beyond, a reality. It’s the politics of unity, embodied by MVP, that will transform our political culture and political system,” explained <b>Matt Nelson, Executive Director, Presente.org.</b></p>

                        <h3>80,000 NEW, UNLIKELY VOTERS ENTER CALIFORNIA'S ELECTORATE</h3>
                        <hr class="star-primary">

                        <p>In just three months, the Million Voters Project (MVP) exceeded its goal of bringing 75,000 first-time voters into California's electorate. As California’s largest statewide grassroots field campaign to mobilize voters, the Million Voters Project is expanding the electorate to better reflect the diversity and emerging majorities in the state. MVP reported that 81,217 new voters were registered by the October 24 registration deadline.</p>

                        <p>Thousands of community leaders organized across the state, focusing on communities most impacted by racial profiling, state violence, low wages, and underfunded schools and services. From prisons and welfare offices, to swap meets and Pokemon stops in 24 California counties, MVP reached out to register new voters and engage potential voters in places that traditional GOTV efforts often overlook. Yesterday was the last day to register to vote in California, but MVP will continue engaging people through Election Day to ensure a large voter turnout on November 8.</p>
                        <p>“MVP is shifting culture and inspiring a path toward equity, dignity, human rights and justice. The MVP partner organizations are creating this culture shift by blending traditional organizing and new technology — using text messaging, tablets and social media to register new voters and ensure they have the information and support they need to go to the polls on election day,” said Matt Nelson, Executive Director, Presente.org. "Digital platforms are having a huge impact on local organizing and voter engagement efforts. With MVP, we’ve created a one-stop digital platform that will continue to build presence and people power leading up to and long after the election.”</p>
                        <p>"Democracy cannot work for us until it includes us. This is just the first step towards engaging at least one million underrepresented and otherwise ignored voters in California by 2018. This is the scale and depth of engagement that we need In order to build a movement for racial, economic, and environmental justice that is powerful and lasting,” said Miya Yoshitani, Executive Director of Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN).
                        </p>
                        <p>“With corporations, speculators, and real estate developers spending more and more in each election, our democratic processes are being bought and our communities are being undermined by big money special interests. Building a large base of voters across the state with other trusted partners, assures that we are able to secure real wins for our neighborhoods, on and off the election cycle," said Christina Livingston, Executive Director of Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment.​
                        </p>
                        <p>“Registering new voters is just the first step in engaging the emerging California majority. This fall the Million Voters Project is leading the largest grassroots civic engagement program in the state to motivate these voters to the polls,” said Karla Zombro, California Calls Field Director. “ And our efforts won’t stop when the election is over. MVP will continue to engage voters one-on-one year round on policies that impact their communities.”
                        </p>
                        <p>By building relationships with people directly, MVP ensures that voters not only get registered but turn out to the polls and become decision-makers on issues that are crucial for the well-being of our communities. Over the next two years, MVP’s targeted organizing will focus on reaching people one-on-one and inspiring people to vote consistently to shift power from big corporations and the wealthy to California’s new majority. MVP aims to turn out more than 450,000 voters on November 8 and build to one million by 2018.</p>

                        <h3>California's largest voter campaign gears up on October 29 to mobilize the vote with thousands of volunteers on the ground</h3>
                        <hr class="star-primary">

                        <p><b>Visuals:</b> Thousands of Community Members will be trained and dispatched for phoning and door-to-door canvassing in Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, Merced, Bakersfield, Fresno, Riverside, Los Angeles, and Oxnard.</p>


                        <p><b>Who:</b><br/>
                            California’s largest voter field campaign, Million Voters Project (MVP) is an innovative coalition of the state’s most prominent community-based networks: Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN), California Calls, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), Mobilize the Immigrant Vote (MIV), and PICO California, with support from Presente.org.</p>
                            <p>MVP mobilizes Black voters, Latinos, Asian Pacific Islanders, immigrants, refugees, faith-based constituencies, those formerly incarcerated, and youth to take part in shaping our political landscape. MVP transforms the electorate by contacting over 600,000 voters by November 2016, and increasing to one million voters by 2018.</p>


                            <p><b>What:</b><br/>
                            <b>Saturday, October 29</b>, the MVP team will ramp up efforts statewide by engaging community members <b>all day</b> from the Bay Area to the Central Valley to Southern California. MVP’s thousands of leaders in 50 locations across the state have been contacting 20,000 voters a day to engage communities deeply on the issues on the ballot. On Saturday, MVP’s six partners and 47 affiliates will be hitting the streets across the state in a coordinated effort to mobilize communities on local and statewide issues. </p>


                            <p><b>Why:</b><br/>
                            MVP <i>registered over 80,000</i> new voters this year, but simply registering people does not result in significant turnout at the polls. Instead of focusing on registration, MVP’s leaders build relationships with community members through one-on-one conversations about regional and statewide policies, ensuring that everyone has the information needed to make empowered decisions at the polls. It’s the personal connection that makes MVP’s ground game unique and powerful. Just 10 days before Election Day, this is key to maintain the momentum that will drive people to the polls to vote on the issues impacting them.</p>


                            <p><b>Where:</b><br/>
                            Join us at any of the volunteer locations across the state to observe MVP’s unique strategy of building relationships with community members and connecting on the issues that impact us all.</p>
